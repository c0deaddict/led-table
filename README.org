* LED table

This repository is about the LED table I created in the first half
of 2017. The table is based on an Ikea LACK table with 15x15
individually addressable full color RGB LED's on it. A Raspberry Pi is
mounted below that controls the LED array.

- [[./build/][Build]]: how the table is made.
- [[./server/][Server]]: code that runs on the Pi.
- [[./client/][Client]]: code that sends images to the server.
