* Client

Use this code to send images (or video) to the Pi and show it on the
LED table. Code is written in Python 3. For the =send_img.py= and
=send_video.py= you need to have OpenCV installed. If you are using
[[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] you can use the =default.nix= by invoking =nix-shell= in the
=client= directory.

The server listens on UDP port 1338 for packets of =3*15*15=
bytes. 3 bytes for each pixel: Red (0-255), Green and Blue. The first
15 pixels are =(x=0,y=0)= to =(14,0)=, the next 15 bytes are for the
next row, eg. =(0,1)= to =(14,1)=.

After 10 minutes of inactivity (no UDP packet's received) the LEDs are
turned off.
